# TnologyDiscordBot
This is the source code to my Discord bot, which is written in TypeScript. It uses Harmony, which is a Discord library that uses Deno as its runtime.<br>

# I'd like to request a feature
If you'd like to request a feature, please create a GitHub suggestion with the "suggestion" label.<br>


# I found a security vulnerability!
If you have found a security vulnerability, please let T_nology know (preferably privately). You may contact T_nology through the following methods:
- **Preferred Method:** Creation of a Management Ticket in T_Cord (https://discord.gg/vKbjwMw) by going to the "#bot-commands" channel, running "-new Security Vulnerability," and selecting "Management Ticket."<br>
- **Alternative Method:** If you do not wish to create a Management Ticket in the Discord server, or you are unable to do so, you can email T_nology at `tnology55@gmail.com`.<br>
- **Other Alternative Method:** You can create a GitHub issue with the "Security Vulnerability" label.<br>


# Configuring the Bot

To configure the bot, please create a `.env` file (with this specific name). I will add documentation later, but for now, there is a `.env.example` file you can use.<br>
`_LOGGING_CHANNEL` values can be set to -1 to be disabled.
