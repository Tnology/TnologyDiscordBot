# I found a security vulnerability!
If you have found a security vulnerability, please let T_nology know (preferably privately). You may contact T_nology through the following methods:
- **Preferred Method:** Creation of a Management Ticket in T_Cord (https://discord.gg/vKbjwMw) by going to the "#bot-commands" channel, running "-new Security Vulnerability," and selecting "Management Ticket."<br>
- **Alternative Method:** If you do not wish to create a Management Ticket in the Discord server, or you are unable to do so, you can email T_nology at `tnology55@gmail.com`.<br>
- **Other Alternative Method:** You can create a GitHub issue with the "Security Vulnerability" label.<br>
