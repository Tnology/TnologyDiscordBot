Pre-Alpha v0.2.9

Changelog:
- I'm back after not having done programming for a long time. I have since pretty much forgotten JavaScript/TypeScript, but I'll try to relearn when I have free time.
- I'm a university student now, so I don't have as much free time as I used to.
- I understand that there are a ton of issues with the bot and that it's extremely unstable. This is why it's in the Pre-Alpha stage.
- However, that's not an excuse for how unusable it is. Hopefully I can find time at some point to relearn at least a little bit of JS/TS and work on the bot.
- Updated the README file.
