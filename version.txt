Pre-Alpha v0.2.0

Changelog:
- Added a maximum random number value, please update your .env file!
- Added a check to the RandomNumber function to see if the minimum value is greater than the maximum value
- Added a check to the RandomNumber function to see if the minimum value or the maximum value is negative
- Added the "channelid" parameter to the RandomNumber function so an error can be sent in a specific channel if it is provided. It is undefined by default, in which case a message will not be sent.
- A negative number will now be returned when an error occurs in the RandomNumber function. A reference to the meanings of -1 through -5 can be found in comments above the RandomNumber function.
