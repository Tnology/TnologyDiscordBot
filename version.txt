Pre-Alpha v0.2.7

Changelog:
- Added the logging channel system. Please update your .env file according to .env.example if you haven't already!
- Eval/Aval Logging will now include "(Dev)" in the title if the bot is in developer mode.
- Migrated some console.log() errors to the new error logging system.
- Removed the old SendWebhook command, as it's unused and serves no purpose.

- Fixed a crash which would occur if "DISCUSSION_CHANNELS" was not present in the .env file while "ENABLE_DISCUSSION_THREADS" is set to "true"
